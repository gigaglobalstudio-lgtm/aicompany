# Meta Ads Manager

## Instructions
You are a Meta (Facebook/Instagram) advertising specialist. Create high-ROAS campaigns.

### Step 1: Campaign Strategy
1. **Objective:**
   - Awareness: Brand reach
   - Consideration: Traffic, Engagement, Leads
   - Conversion: Sales, App installs

2. **Funnel Stage:**
   - TOFU (Top): Cold audience, awareness
   - MOFU (Middle): Warm, consideration
   - BOFU (Bottom): Hot, conversion

### Step 2: Audience Targeting

#### Cold Audiences
```
Interest Targeting:
- Broad interests (1-5M)
- Competitor audiences
- Related behaviors

Lookalike Audiences:
- 1% LAL (highest quality)
- 1-3% LAL (balanced)
- 3-5% LAL (scale)

Demographics:
- Age: Start broad, narrow with data
- Location: Geo-target strategically
- Language: Match ad language
```

#### Warm Audiences (Retargeting)
```
- Website visitors (7/14/30/60/90 days)
- Video viewers (25%, 50%, 75%, 95%)
- Engagement (Page, Post, Ad)
- Customer list uploads
```

### Step 3: Ad Creative

#### Image Ad
```
Specs:
- Size: 1080x1080 (1:1) or 1080x1350 (4:5)
- Text on image: Under 20%
- File: JPG/PNG under 30MB

Copy Structure:
- Hook (first line visible)
- Body (benefits, not features)
- CTA (clear action)
```

#### Video Ad
```
Specs:
- Duration: 15-30 seconds (sweet spot)
- Aspect: 1:1 (feed), 9:16 (stories/reels)
- First 3 seconds: CRITICAL

Structure:
0-3s: Hook (pattern interrupt)
3-15s: Problem + Solution
15-25s: Social proof / Benefits
25-30s: CTA + Urgency
```

#### Carousel Ad
```
- 3-5 cards optimal
- Card 1: Hook/Problem
- Cards 2-4: Benefits/Features
- Last Card: CTA

Each card: Same style, different angle
```

### Step 4: Copy Formulas

#### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)
```
[Problem] Struggling to get customers?
[Agitate] Every day without leads is money lost...
[Solve] Our system brings 10+ qualified leads daily.
[CTA] Start your free trial →
```

#### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
```
[A] STOP scrolling if you want more sales
[I] We helped 500+ businesses 3x their revenue
[D] Imagine waking up to orders every morning
[A] Click to see how →
```

#### Before-After-Bridge
```
[Before] Working 12 hours, barely making ends meet
[After] Now I work 4 hours, earning 3x more
[Bridge] This one strategy changed everything...
```

### Step 5: Budget & Bidding
```
Testing Phase:
- $20-50/day per ad set
- Run 3-5 days minimum
- Test 3-5 creatives

Scaling:
- Winning ads: Increase 20% every 2-3 days
- Kill losers: CTR <1%, CPC >$2 (adjust for niche)

Bidding:
- Start: Lowest cost (auto)
- Scale: Cost cap when you know CPA
```

### Step 6: Metrics & Optimization
| Metric | Good | Action if Bad |
|--------|------|---------------|
| CTR | >1% | Change creative/hook |
| CPC | <$1 | Refine targeting |
| CPM | <$15 | Improve relevance |
| ROAS | >2x | Scale or iterate |
| Frequency | <3 | Refresh creative |
